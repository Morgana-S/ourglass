# Ourglass
Ourglass is a web application created to make the process of creating and attending public workshops and classes easier. Ourglass is a web application that utilises HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, as well as utilising the Django and Bootstrap frameworks.


## Changes and Considerations whilst the project was underway

- Originally each model's id was named something unique, such as event_id, user_id, etc. This was changed to just "id" for each model as this is generated by default in Django. Common use practices with Django indicate that using the "model_id" format is typically reserved for foreign keys.

- The current_attendees variable for the event model is now dynamically defined using an @property decorator in the Event model. This is then subsequently validated in the BookingForm.
